This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r Load Packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
  library(httr)
  library(jsonlite)
  library(reshape2)
  library(reshapeGUI)
```

```{r Load JSON, include=FALSE}
  metrics_raw <- GET("https://api.breadcrumbinsights.com/savedsets/62?token=boHGrFQIGqhzacyJINiK7uBG")
  
  metrics_text <- content(metrics_raw, "text")

  metrics_json <- fromJSON(metrics_text, flatten=TRUE)
```

```{r JSON DataFrame, paged.print=TRUE}
  metrics_json
```
